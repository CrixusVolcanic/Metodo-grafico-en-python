# Graphical Method Implementation in Python

This repository contains an implementation of the graphical method in Python, designed by Davian Bermudez. The graphical method is a technique used in linear programming to solve optimization problems involving two variables. This approach provides a visual representation of the feasible region and the optimal solution.

## Features

- **Linear Programming**: Solves linear programming problems using the graphical method.
- **Visualization**: Provides a graphical representation of the constraints and objective function.
- **Optimization**: Identifies the optimal solution by analyzing the feasible region.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
